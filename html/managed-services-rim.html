<h2>Benchmarking, Sourcing & Procurement</h2>
<p>Managed services and cloud utility are the most complex disciplines in the IT sourcing landscape. Key challenges for transforming your business using best-​​in-​​class outsourced infrastructure include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex in-​​source vs. outsource decisions:</strong><<br>
With hundreds of cost and service quality dimensions, the initial decision to outsource can be fraught with risk.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of approaches:</strong><<br>
Options range from full-​​service outsourcing to local and remote device management to narrowly targeted professional services (e.g. remote DBA), and end-​​user support provided by domestic, near shore or offshore managed services providers.</li>
<li><strong>Dozens of pricing models:</strong><<br>
Unlike other IT outsourcing disciplines, non-​​traditional pricing strategies such as revenue share, SLA-​​driven compensation, and both hourly and per device /​ instance fees open opportunities for optimization of existing arrangements.</li>
<li><strong>Long path to support of critical processes</strong><br>
Installation and ramp-​​up timelines are often measured in months, and lack of documentation and/​or resistance to change on the part of incumbents – internal and external alike – can undermine the process at critical junctures. The impact of positive change can be staggering in terms of cost, service uptime, process visibility /​ transparency, metrics, and the ability of IT to absorb and respond to business needs. The downside can be crippling, with many instances of high frustration and near-​​insurmountable switching costs.</li>
</ul>
