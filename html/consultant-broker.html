Many of RampRate’s most successful projects were performed for end-​​clients that have never heard of RampRate  We don’t necessarily want to be famous; we want to revolutionize sourcing through data.

      <div class="panel-body"><p>It’s tough to sell square feet of office space all your life and now have to talk about kilowatts or PUE ratios for data centers. And being a top expert in IT transformation doesn’t mean that you know how much latency or jitter is needed for each of your client’s apps. But when you’re not quick with their jargon, half the room tunes out. So when you need that extra edge to get to a technical audience, bring RampRate along.</p>
      <p>RampRate is more that a database and a methodology. Our staff is composed of industry-​​recognized experts in our practice areas: Data Center, Cloud, Network Services/​Telecom, CDN, and Managed Services. When you engage RampRate with your client, whether as a direct partner or a “backroom” service hidden from the end-​​client, you’re getting access to an array of powerful technical experts who are focused on the search for sourcing perfection.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>Even if you’re not a candidate for direct referral fees from RampRate, you may be able to fund a very profitable relationship with your client solely from the amount your client saves after a RampRate engagement.</p>
      <p>Here’s the story:  RampRate works on deals with a minimum of $1M in annual spend in a particular practice area (data center, telecom, CDN, managed services, cloud, etc.).  ON AVERAGE – not best case – we save 20% across the board on spending.  Since our average deal is typically 10-​​50 times our minimum, your client can realistically expect to see between $200,000 to $10M in savings. Those savings often go to new research projects, advisory fees, and other services that were previously under-​​funded. And, yes, these results are typical.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>Your firm may have a partner in each market that is willing to pay you a referral fee for bringing them a data center or CDN deal, but deep down you know that it may not be the right solution and will not increase your credibility with the client. They may not even pick your partner, or may terminate a contract early, leaving you with a mess you never bargained for. RampRate, on the other hand, partners with everybody (400+ vendors), and has proven its objectivity to more than 100 clients. With uniform referral fees and client-​​driven decision making processes, its methodology is unbiased and failure rate negligible.</p></div>

RampRate’s SPY Index, along with our expert resources and methodology shine a light where none has existed before, leading to confidence and participation by all stakeholders in a deal.</p></div>
