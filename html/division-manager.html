      <div class="panel-body"><p>We collect and source data points on hundreds of vendor selection and service location criteria including tax environment, client satisfaction, and even corporate citizenship (no nasty surprises).  You’re assured you’re working with the best vendors – and at the same time you know you’re getting the best market price from your vendors.</p>
      <p>We’ll identify and work with known-​​good vendors to bring you data to make the right decision.  We’ll even negotiation directly with vendors on your behalf using all the skill gained from negotiating thousands of contracts over more than a decade.</p>
      <p>The most compelling basis for a decision is built on facts.  RampRate can help you build a case you’re confident is the best one.<p></div>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>RampRate is unique in that we don’t start a project from square one.  We maintain a very comprehensive database, the SPY Index™, which allows us to shortcut the time usually spent evaluating and sourcing a project to a few weeks, not several months.</p>
      <p>Plus, you’ll never have to guess if your cost goals are reasonable – we’ll show you benchmark data so that you know for sure what is realistic.  It’s data, not opinion.</p></div>

      <div class="panel-body"><p>Are you carrying a 20-​​pound weight around your neck when starting the race? Lean is mean, and RampRate has the data and relationships to show you exactly where you stand versus others.  Of course, we’d never identify specific companies, but we will show you specifically how your spending – on internal or external services -- compares to industry and like-​​size business.</p>
      <p>If you’re paying too much it could mean one of several things:  Your costs have not kept pace with the market, or external vendor contracts were negotiated with imperfect knowledge of real prices being paid in the market today, or your internal service organization is simply not as efficient as comparable external alternatives.</p></div>
