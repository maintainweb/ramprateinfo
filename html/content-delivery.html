<p class="lead">Content delivery is a race to zero – no matter how big a discount you got last week, someone else is probably finding a better deal today.</p>
<p>Most vendor margins are in the fine print – value added services, revenue commitments, regional surcharges, edge code execution, etc.  Worse, most of this extra expense is hidden until you get the bill – many buyers are blindsided by their real costs of content delivery.</p>
<p><strong>But there’s good news:</strong></p>
<p>The 800 pound Gorilla’s grip on the premium end of the market is loosening – there’s a real competitive market no matter what type of content you have.</p>
<p><strong>RampRate will help you find the right answers.</strong></p>
