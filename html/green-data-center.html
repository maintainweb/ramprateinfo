New requirements are on the table in almost all countries around the world. The United Kingdom, for example, has legislation that will impact data center customers significantly starting in 2010, completely changing the cost of sourcing co-​​location and outsourcing computing. The United States has several bills in Congress, awaiting action, any one of which could increase the cost of in-​​house and third-​​party data center services.</p>
      <p>Ramp^Rate tracks the state of regulatory requirements on a per-​​country basis, to help our clients understand the potential impact of current and upcoming legislation on new and existing data center services.</p></div>
